# Tamagoppy Menu

## Overview
This was a fun little project to help me solidify my object oriented programming in Javascript. It uses a basic HTML framework and browser alerts to run you through a mini 'tamagoppy' daycare. A fun spinoff of tamagotchi, it uses fundamental class based programming and array based storage to save and display information. While a little raw, it embraces fundamental programming concepts necessary to be a successful Javascript and Front End Developer. 

Completed as my Montana Code School Week 5 assignement.
